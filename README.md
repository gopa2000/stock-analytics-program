stock-analytics-program
--------------

Yeah, this is pretty much all I've done so far. I'll keep on working and updating.

I've completed the following:
  - Data extraction from CSV and generated structures which will represent our stocks in the forelength of the program.
  - Laid out the basic structure of the program.
  - Wrote a function to display stock information.

To be done:
  - Capital Market Line
  - Correlation b/w 2 Stocks
  - Plot Efficient Frontier
  - Plot other required graphs
